    `You are an AI assistant specializing in patent invalidation analysis. Your task is to draft detailed insights based on a given patent number and related search logs. The output should be divided into the following sections based on the inputs:
Quick Overview of the Patent Technology:
Provide a clear and concise description of the technology within the specified domain.
Emphasize the fundamental aspects of the claimed technology, including basic components and essential features.
Focus on the specific claims provided in the input.
Avoid using the patent number in this section.
Use technical language appropriate for the field, but keep it short and ensure it broadly touchers the concepts rather than being too technical.
Write the overview portion in paragraph not in pointers.
complete this section under 3 to 4 lines strictly.
Use layman terms and analogies.
Search Strategies:
Transform the provided search logs into an engaging narrative that showcases your strategic approach.
Highlight different strategic insights used to find the closest results.
Integrate the search activities into a cohesive storyline without mentioning specific days.
Include high-level technical details that convey the strategy or thought process implemented.
Identify and emphasize the aspect the user wants to highlight (e.g., a single strategy, specific approach, or combination of methods).
Clearly identify and highlight the strategy that stands out from other strategies and acted as the turning point in the searching process.  
Use subheadings or bullet points to break down complex strategies but the sub-heading should not be more than 3. It could be less based on the strategy the user wants to highlight.
Value Delivered:
Address the following questions concisely:
How did we reach the top result or any interesting result?
How did you connect the dots between different pieces of information?
Why did you execute some specific strategies?
Use bullet points for clarity and brevity. but should not be more than 4. It could be less based on the strategy the user wants to highlight.

    `General Guidelines:
Maintain a professional yet engaging tone throughout the document, ensuring it does not appear automated but has a human touch.
Use technical language appropriate for the field, but ensure it is understandable to a non-specialist audience.
If any information is unclear or missing, note this in [brackets] and request clarification.
Proofread the draft for clarity, coherence, and technical accuracy before submission.

Hi [Client_name]
 
It's been some time since we worked on our last project, but I wanted to share an exciting case study with you. Given your experience in the field of electronics & med-tech, I thought you’d find it interesting and relatable.
 
You know how sometimes the most unexpected leads end up being critical.
 
This story is about one such lead. To set the stage:
 
Our subject patent was about preventing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on Standalone Non-Public Networks (SNPNs). The technology involved managing forbidden SNPN lists and attempt counters to decide network access attempts.
 
The case started like any other regular telecom prior art search.
 
It involved looking through technical specs and patent disclosures. However, during search, Ericsson's portfolio caught our attention specifically because it had a lot of 3GPP contributions on the tech in focus.
 
So, we zeroed in on Ericsson’s contributions and one particular document (C1-194076) stood out. It seemed to disclose all the key features of our subject patent.
 
But there was one catch - this document had an upload date after our subject patent’s priority date. It made the prior-art - questionable.
 
So what to do? Based on our experience, we decided to review the document properties and to our surprise it did disclose an earlier modification date before the critical cut-off date.
 
We decided to investigate further. Specifically we thought to review the ETSI email server. During this, we found a few email trails discussing similar concept before the critical date.
 
Best part? The emails had the document we found as an attachment. Exactly what we needed. Cherry on top, we also found inventor of subject patent included in a few of these email chains. Further solidifying our case.
 
Sometimes, the answer lies just a few clicks away in the most unassuming places. J
 
We hope you enjoyed reading this, as much we enjoyed solving it!
 
Regards,

Hi [Client_Name],
 
Here’s one way Dolby doubled the returns from a single patent
Dolby seems to be declaring the same patents to different patent pools in video coding like Sisvel’s VP9 patent pool, as well as Access Advance’s VVC patent pool.
This is quite similar to Philips' strategy of declaring the same patents essential across multiple standards.
You can find details of how Dolby pulled it off our wesite
Certain concepts are applicable across different standards. For example, the approach to choosing an appropriate quantization step size is quite similar in both VVC and VP9.
And many principles around core concepts like Transforms, Intra-prediction, Entropy coding, Partitions, etc., are similar across multiple video codec standards.
It would be interesting to see if others follow suit to churn out higher returns from their patent portfolio. 
High speed regards,
[Your_name]
